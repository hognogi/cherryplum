## Cherryplum ##

A simple, straight-forward, easy to understand, node.js framework, designed to serve simple applications with multiple interfaces (ex web/admin). 

Best use case for this framework would probably be for simple api's, simple projects, as a learning tool, or simply as an entry point in the node ecosystem. 

It is designed with simplicity in mind, and it should be treated as such. 

Use it however you like, even if you think it's bad, I hope it will serve as an inspiration to create something better.   

It is used to power up  [this blog here](http://www.hognogi.com/), and you may find the the entire code for that blog in [this git repository](https://github.com/hognogi/cherryplum-blog). 

To install:

    git clone https://github.com/hognogi/cherryplum.git
    npm install 
    node app.js #alias: npm start.

The default localhost route should be:

	http://localhost:2111/
